# Intro to CS - Repl.it Lab

## Objective: 
In this lab, you will learn how to use `Repl.it`. These will help you organize your work for this year and for the rest of your journey at MEET!


## Instructions:

1. Make sure you have created a `Repl.it` account with the link provided by your instructors:
    1. Your username should include your firstname, first 2 letters of lastname, and year of graduation.
       - For example: "KendaZo26"
    3. If you need help with this, ask a TA or Instructor!

2. Once you've created an account, click on the `+ Create Repl` button on the left.
   1. Now, choose `Python` as your Template!
    2. For Title, write "Intro to CS - First & Last name"
    3. Lastly, click again on the `+ Create Repl` button.

3. On the group page, you can see all your current labs.
    1. You should see one called `01 - Intro to CS`--click to start the lab.
-->

3. Now you should see the main repl.it page. There are 4 main parts of the page we'll cover:
    - The console
    - The files
    - The editor
    - The run button

Let's take them one by one!

# The Main Repl.it page

1. The console
    - The console is the black box.
    - The console lets you run python code line by line.
    - This is great because you see your output immediately!
   <!--
    - Try pasting this code into the console and hitting `ENTER` to run it!
        - `print("Hello World!")`
        - Note: Use ctr shift V to paste your code to the console.
   -->     
2. The files
    - The console is great, but it only runs code once.
    - If we want to save our code to run it again, we can put it in a `file`.
    - The files are on the left of the screen. You should see a file called `main.py`.
        - All `python` files end with `.py`
    - Click on `main.py` (it may already be selected).
    
3. The editor
    - The editor is the white box.
    -  The editor lets us write code in our files, then run it again and again.
    - Paste this code into the editor:
        - `print("Hello Y1s!")`
        
4. The run button
    - You can run the code in your `main.py` file by clicking the `Run` button at the top of the screen.
    - Click it, then watch for the result of your code in the console.
    - If you don't see `"Hello Y1s!"`, ask another classmate for help.
        - Check in with a TA or Instructor if you still need help.

<!--
5. The test tab
    - Tests help us make sure our code is working correctly.
    - Click the checkmark on the left of the screen to open the tests tab.
    - Click the `Run tests` button to run tests on your code.
    - If you copied the code exactly from step `3`--it should pass!
        - If the test doesn't pass, ask another classmate for help.

5. The submit button
    - Once you've followed all the steps in a lab and the test passes, you can click the submit button.
    - Only submit if you are *confident* you have finished your lab--if you have any questions, ask a TA or Instructor!
-->
##### Great job on completing your first Lab!

If you have extra time, continue to the **Bonus Problems** *below*.

## Bonus Problems:

1. Try creating a new file in the file explorer--name it whatever you like, but remember to add `.py` at the end!
    - Now try deleting the new file.

2. Add this line to your code: `print("Goodbye! See You Next Session)`
    - Run your code again. It will show an error!
    - What do you think is the problem ? Try fixing it and run your code again!
