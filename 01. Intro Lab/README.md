# Intro to CS - IDLE Lab

## Objective
In this lab, you will learn how to use **IDLE**, Python's built-in development environment. This will help you organize your work for this year and for the rest of your journey at MEET!

---

## Instructions

### 1. Create a Folder
- Create a folder on your computer called **Summer Labs**.  
- This is where you will save all your Python work throughout the program.

### 2. Open IDLE
- Open **IDLE** (Python’s built-in editor).  
- On most computers, you can find it by searching for “IDLE” in your Applications or Start Menu.

### 3. Write Your First Python Code
- In the IDLE window, click **File > New File** to open a new editor window.  
- Type the following code:

    ```python
    print("Hello Y1s!")
    ```

### 4. Save Your File
- Click **File > Save As…**  
- Save the file inside your **Summer Labs** folder.  
- Name your file: `intro_lab.py`  
  *(Make sure it ends with `.py`)*

### 5. Run Your Code
- Click **Run > Run Module** or press `F5`.  
- You should see the following output in the Python Shell:

    ```
    Hello Y1s!
    ```

- If it doesn’t work, double-check your code. Ask a classmate or TA for help if needed.

## Submitting Your Work

###  Submit Form
- Once you're done, go to the submission form:  
  https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd4clINkBzIekgbJFS7KkQTWHZFvm7B1qMBHR3klHrIGG9Y7g/viewform 
- Upload a screenshot of your code and output, or paste the file path to your `.py` file.  
- Submit the form **only if you are confident** that you finished the lab.  
- If you’re unsure, ask a TA or Instructor before submitting.

##  Bonus Problems ✅

### 1. Create and Delete a New File
- In your **Summer Labs** folder:  
  - Open a new file in IDLE and name it `bonus1.py`.  
  - Write anything inside it, save it, and then try deleting it.

### 2. Debug a Syntax Error
- In your original file, replace your code with this:

    ```python
    print("Goodbye! See You Next Session)
    ```

- Save and run the file.  
- You’ll see an error! Can you figure out what’s wrong?  
- Try fixing the error and running the code again.

 **Great job on completing your first lab!**  🎉🎉🎉
If you have extra time, keep exploring IDLE and have fun coding!
