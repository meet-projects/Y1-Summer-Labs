# Strings Lab

## Objective: 
In this lab, you will learn how to use **strings**, as well as make sure you grasp the idea of **Input/Output**!

## Instructions:

### 1) Syntax: 
1. In the python editor, type `print('Hello World')` and hit **run**.  
    - What do you see?
    
2. Now on a new line type `print("Hello World")` and hit **run** again.
    - Did anything change?
    
3. Print "Hello" to your partner by including **their name** on a new line.
    - For example `"Hello Emma"`. 
    - Show it to them!

4. Now on a new line type `#print("Hello World")` and hit **run**.
    - What happens when you run the code? 
    - **Answer:** You have just made a **comment**. Python does not read anything after the `#` symbol (but people looking at your code do).
    - Comments are useful for explaining your code so that when you or someone else goes back to review the code they know how a piece of code works and what it does!

---
### 2) Input Output : 
1. In the **python editor**, make a **variable** called `sentence1` that takes **input** from the user, like this:
```python
sentence1 = input("Say something! ")
```

2. **Run** your code, and test it out if it's working properly so far!

3. Create another **variable** and call it `sentence2`, that works just like `sentence1`.

4. After the user gives input to the 2 variables (`sentence1` and `sentence2`), make it print both sentences in 1 line.
    - Example: 
    - Let's say `sentence1` was `"Hello, my name is "`
    - And `sentence2` was `"Loai, and I'm 15 years old!"`
    - It should print `"Hello, my name is Loai, and I'm 15 years old!"`
      
5. Try printing this output in capital letters. (Hint: Use "your_string".upper())
   
7. How many letters are in this sentence? print the length of the sentence using len().

#### Amazing Work!  
<!--
### 3) Operators: 

1. Copy paste this code into your **Repl.it** editor:
```python
s1 = " together until we "
s2 = " all the same."
s3 = "Let's all be unique "
s4 = " realise we are " 
```

2. Using the string operations, combine these strings to complete the meaning, then print it out.

-->
### Wrapping up:
- Please show your work to an Instructor or TA!
- When you're done, make sure to submit the lab with the Submit button on the top right.
- Do the bonus section to experiment with more string FUNctions.

<!-- 

Run the test.

- If it passes:
    - When you're done, make sure to submit the lab with the Submit button on the top right.
- If it fails:
    - Review the lab to see if you missed any steps. You need to follow the steps exactly to pass.
    - If you have questions, ask a classmate, or call over an Instructor or TA!

## Bonus Problems:

### 1) Greetings: 

1. Using `input()`, Write a program that asks "What's your name?" and stores your name in a **variable**. Be sure to name your variable something that makes sense and is easy to remember, like: `name`.

2. Add a line at the end of the program that **prints** `"Hello there, "` followed by your name. 
    - Your program should look something like this:
    <img src='https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/7kHgPKL6_DvyZ-3O1y9d63sfDDfq3WOwR7HKYuJM8rd8suSGbwtDoHPWx2s6r5FfsPu1ejcmupL-HdH62SqzUM__vbR8DF4l_prrG_xUON4HYmLri1HByxtcfiinkcDoHCtNb_c'>

3. Use some of the methods we learned to make sure that when the computer **prints** out your name, the **first letter** is always capitalized, even if you typed in all lowercase. Run your program to test it out. 
    - Remember you can ask your partner for help if you have trouble!

4. Find the **length** of the name, and store this number in a **variable**. 

5. Add another line to your program that prints `"Your name is (length) letters long!"`.

6. Do you remember **indexing**? Add another line to the program that **prints** out `"The first letter of your name is [first letter] and the last letter is [last letter]."` 
    - Capitalize both of the letters.
    - Example: If `name` was `Loai`, the program should print `"The first letter of your name is L and the last letter is I."`


7. Test that your code works for **ANY** name by trying a few *different* names.
    - You can even ask a neighbor to write out name suggestions to help you in testing!
  
### 2) int() & raw_input(): 
1. Using `input()`, Write a program that asks "What's your age?" and store the user's age in a **variable**. 

2. Multiply the user's age by your age.

3. Print out the result.

4. Is this the result you expected? Try fixing it using one of the following functions: `raw_input` , `int()`
    - Remember you can ask your partner or CS team  for help if you have trouble
