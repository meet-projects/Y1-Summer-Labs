# Datatypes Lab

## Objective: 
In this lab, you will learn about different data types, including `int`, `float`, `str`, and `bool`, and how to use `type()` to determine what data type a variable is, using **Python**.

> Before we start, navigate to Repl.it and `+ Create Repl` with the title `DataTypes & Vars - Your Name`


## Instructions:

1. Working with other classmates, take a look at the following python snippets:
    - `print(type(259+33))`
    - `print(type(259-33.0))`
    - `print(type(4))`
    - `print(type('4'))`
    - `print(type('four'))`
    - `print(type(5/2.0))`
    - `print(type(12 > 2*5))`
    - `print(type('color'*4))`
    
    > Remember, we use the `print` statement to see what's happening inside python.

1. Go over each line with your partner, and try to guess what each line returns as an **output**... discuss what your guesses are!

1. Now, after you're done guessing and discussing, let's put your theories to the test!
    - Write each line in the Repl.it **editor**, then press the `Run` button and understand why it is what it is.
    - If you don't understand something specific, try and ask your partner first :)



##### Great job!

## Wrapping up:

Let's submit the lab!
    - Once you've followed all the steps in a lab, go to the Master link.
    - Click on the submission link for this lab - https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdWugw5465ptLjm1xvk9d_SqT7eB4yBKO2YIq8Mxp-I3ciuLQ/viewform?usp=sf_link 
    - In the survey, copy your replit lab url, and copy it in the right place.
    - Submit the survey!

    if you have any questions, ask a classmate, TA or Instructor!


You can go on to try the `bonus problems` at the bottom of the lab. Be sure you don't change any of the code you already wrote!

## Bonus Problems: 
1. Try typing all of the lines again without the word `type` at the beginning. First guess what the code will do, then run it. What do you get?

2. If you have extra time, complete yesterday's lab(s).


#### Great job on completing the bonus problems section!
