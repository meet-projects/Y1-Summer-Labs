# Datatypes Lab

## Objective: 
In this lab, you will learn about different data types, including `int`, `float`, `str`, and `bool`, and how to use `type()` to determine what data type a variable is, using **Python**.

> Before we start, navigate to Repl.it and `+ Create Repl` with the title `DataTypes & Vars - Your Name`


## Instructions:

1. Working with other classmates, take a look at the following python snippets:
    - `print(type(259+33))`
    - `print(type(259-33.0))`
    - `print(type(4))`
    - `print(type('4'))`
    - `print(type('four'))`
    - `print(type(5/2.0))`
    - `print(type(12 > 2*5))`
    - `print(type('color'*4))`
    
    > Remember, we use the `print` statement to see what's happening inside python.

1. Go over each line with your partner, and try to guess what each line returns as an **output**... discuss what your guesses are!

1. Now, after you're done guessing and discussing, let's put your theories to the test!
    - Write each line in the Repl.it **editor**, then press the `Run` button and understand why it is what it is.
    - If you don't understand something specific, try and ask your partner first :)



##### Great job!

## Wrapping up:

Run the test.
- If it passes:
    - You can go on to try the bonus problems at the bottom of the lab. Be sure you don't change any of the code you already wrote!
    - When you're done, make sure to submit the lab with the `Submit` button on the top right.
- If it fails:
    - Review the lab to see if you missed any steps. You need to follow the steps _exactly_ to pass.
    - If you have questions, ask a classmate, or call over an Instructor or TA!

## Bonus Problems: 
1. Try typing all of the lines again without the word `type` at the beginning. First guess what the code will do, then run it. What do you get?

2. If you have extra time, complete yesterday's lab(s).


##### Great job on completing the bonus problems section!  

###### Make sure the test passes, and that you submit the lab.
