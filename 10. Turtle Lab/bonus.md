    - There are many different programming languages, **Python** is one of the most powerful ones!
    - This code (in the image) is written in **Javascript**; We haven't learned Javascript already, but try to understand the lines of code and using python, come up with the same image!
    - **NOTE:** No need to make the eye animations, but if you can, it's a huge bonus!
    - If you are interested in learning more about animation and graphics programming, you can check out Khan Academy's videos on JavaScript programming here: https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/programming.
