> Before we start, navigate to Repl.it and `+ Create Repl` with the title `Debugging - Your Name`

## Instructions:

### Debugging Practice: 
Below, you can find 3 mini programs that are written incorrectly.  
We will provide what each program's intention is, and your job is to copy-paste it to your **Repl.it** editor and fix it!  

1. Intention: Print out `"My name is student"`
```python
my_name = "student"
print("My name is ' + 'my_name")
```  

2. Intention: Print out `"I am 15 years old"`  
```python
my_age = 15
print('I am ' + my_age + ' years old')
```  

3. Intention: Print out the **total score**
```python
score = 4
count = "5"
total = score * count

print(total)
```

### Great job on completing the Lab!

## Bonus Problems: 

- Read about Python DataTypes Conversion. Focus on str() and int().

- Copy and paste errors 2 and 3 from the previous part, and try fixing them using str() and int().

##### Great job on completing the bonus problems section!
