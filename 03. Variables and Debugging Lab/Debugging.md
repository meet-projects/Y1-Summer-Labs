# Debugging Lab

## Objective: 
In this lab, you will learn how to *recognize* **errors** in code and try to fix them following **PEP**!

> Before we start, navigate to the Repl.it assignment associated with this lab in the Teams tab!


## Instructions:

### Debugging Practice: 
Below, you can find 3 mini programs that are written incorrectly.  
We will provide what each program's intention is, and your job is to copy-paste it to your **Repl.it** and fix it!  

1. Intention: Print out `"My name is student"`
```python
my_name = "student"
print("My name is ' + 'my_name")
```  

2. Intention: Print out `"I am 15 years old"`  
```python
my_age = 15
print('I am ' + my_age + ' years old')
```  

3. Intention: Print out the **total score**
```python
score = 4
count = "5"
total = score * count

print(total)
```

## Wrapping up:
- Please reach out to your TAs or Instructors if you have any questions!
- When you're done, make sure to submit the lab with the Submit button on the top right.

<!--
Run the test.

- If it passes:
    - When you're done, make sure to submit the lab with the Submit button on the top right.
- If it fails:
    - Review the lab to see if you missed any steps. You need to follow the steps exactly to pass.
    - If you have questions, ask a classmate, or call over an Instructor or TA!
-->

### Great job on completing the Lab!

### Bonus Problems: 

- Read about Python DataTypes Conversion. Focus on str() and int().
- How can you use those functions to fix the errors above?
- Copy and paste errors 2 and 3 from the previous part, and try fixing them using str() and int().
