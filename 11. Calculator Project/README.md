> Before we start, navigate to Repl.it and `+ Create Repl` with the title `Calculator Project - Your Name`

## Motivation:
- The purpose of this project is to combine and use all concepts we have learned in CS so far in Y1 Summer!  
- It is also your **first opportunity** to build an **application** using the **Input/Output** concept!

## User Experience (UX)
- This is your first experience in UX design! It's critical and very important you think about user experience.
- User experience is as important as writing your code!
    - Is your app enjoyable/intuitive/easy to use?
    - Why should users choose your calculator over any other calculator application?
    - What about your application that makes it extra useful/enjoyable and adds value to it?

- Building a great application requires **empathy**... put yourself in the shoes of the user while building it!

## Objectives:
> Important: You need to finish all objectives to be done with minimum requirements. You do not have to do the objectives by order but you can't move to bonuses without finishing all minimum requirements and getting approval from your TA/Instructor. 
1. The Basic 4: 
    - Create a calculator that processes at least the basic 4 symbols (Addition(+), Subtraction(-), Multiplication(*), and Division(/)) 
    - The calculator has to take as an **input** at least 2 numbers and 1 of the symbols in order to create an equation.
    - The input should be a one-line equation. for example `3 - 4` , instead of taking 3 separate inputs.
    - The calculator has to return the **value** of the **given equation**.
2. Exponents:
    - An exponent refers to the **number of times** a number is **multiplied** by *itself*.
        - For example, 2 to the 3rd (written like this: 2^3) means: 2 x 2 x 2 = 8.
    - The calculator has to process exponents as well.
        - For example, if the user writes `2**3`, it should return `8` as the result.
        - Remember that `2**3` means 2 to the power of 3 or 2^3.
     
3. Run Continuously:
    - The program must run **continuously** until the user decides to stop/exit the application.
    - Think about a **user friendly** way how this can be implemented. 
4. Error Handling:
    - What happens when you write:
        - An invalid equation. (For example: `3 - 4 + `)
        - An unsupported symbol. (For example `,` or `@`)
        - Dividing by 0 (For example `5 / 0`)
        - What if I enter a random string. (For example: `Potato` or `New York City`). Hint: `isdigit()`
        - Your calculator should handle floats. (For example `5 / 2.4`)

    - Handle all of these resulting errors and make sure to print a clear error message for each.
    - Make sure to cover all similar gaps in your application, to make sure it's as **user friendly** as possible!
5. Menu:
    - Include a menu of operations/actions options that is displayed when your application starts running.
    - This menu should serve as instructions to the user, to know how to use your application!
      

## Challenges: *(Extra)*
*You can pick any/all of these if you like!* In other words, you don't have to do them in order.  

1. Add the option to take more than two numbers! For example, computing an expression like 3 + 4 / 2 with three numbers, or being able to make an expression such as 3 + 4 with only two numbers. 
2. Take more than one symbol, and make sure that you calculate the right order of operations. 
3. Add a history of operations list/dictionary!


> Turtle is a Python library that enables users to create pictures and shapes by providing them with a virtual canvas. Here's MEET's [Introduction to Turtle](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/12hUghofRqPTL3jsDazqqUrrr8-GfMe68-IFim9XTEDI/edit?usp=sharing) Lecture. You will need to learn Turtle for the rest of the challenges.
4. Show the calculator results using turtle! 
    - Something that looks like this:

## Go Crazy: *(Extra)*
1. Full Functional Graphics! (Turtle)
    - Something that looks like this:
